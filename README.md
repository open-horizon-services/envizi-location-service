Let'ss us look at how to install this application and run it.

## Prerequisite

Python 3.x should be installed and available.

## 1. Installation

#### 1.1 Download this repo

1. Download this repo (https://github.com/ibm-ecosystem-engineering/envizi-location-service). 

2. Let's assume the repository has been downloaded, and available in the location `/Users/xyz/envizi-location-service`.

    Let's call this as a root folder.

    Don't forget to replace the `/Users/xyz/envizi-location-service` with your folder structure, wherever we refer in this document.

#### 1.2 Create Python virtual environment

1. Open a new command or terminal window.

2. Goto the repository root folder by running the below command.

    **Note:** Don't forget to replace the `/Users/xyz/envizi-location-service` with your folder structure.

    ```
    cd /Users/xyz/envizi-location-service
    ```

3. Create python `virtual environment` by running the below command.

    ```
    python -m venv myvenv-location-svc
    source myvenv-location-svc/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install the required python packages by running the below command.
    ```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### 1.3 Create .env file

1. Create `.env` file with the below entries (you should be still in the root folder of the repo /Users/xyz/envizi-location-service )

```
# Environment variables
LOGLEVEL = INFO

LOCATION_API_URL = "https://api.weather.com/v3/location/search"
LOCATION_API_KEY = ""

OUTPUT_FOLDER = "output"
WRITE_INTERIM_FILES=TRUE
```

2. Update the `LOCATION_API_URL` and `LOCATION_API_KEY` properties with your data.

They are weather API URL and key.

1. Run the below commands to start the app

    ```
    python src/main.py
 
    ```
